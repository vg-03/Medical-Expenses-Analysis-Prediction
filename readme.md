Download the dataset '.csv' file to the same folder as the code and run.

The project will involve several steps, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation. The dataset will be prepared by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features. Various regression algorithms, such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting, will be explored and evaluated to determine the most effective model for cost prediction.

By leveraging machine learning techniques, this project aims to provide valuable insights into medical cost prediction and contribute to more accurate financial planning in the healthcare industry
